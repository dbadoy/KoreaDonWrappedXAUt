# KoreaDonWrappedXAUt
Wrap XAUt (Gold token, troy ounces units) to Korea `Don` units.

## Rational
[XAUt](https://gold.tether.to/) is a digital token backed by physical gold and backed by Tether. This token is traded in troy ounces, which is the unit used in gold trading internationally. <br>
`Don` is the unit used to trade gold in South Korea, with 1 `Don` equal to 3.75 grams. This unit is used in South Korea when talking about gold units, mostly in `Don` and sometimes in grams, but rarely in ounces. <br>
Therefore, when you hold XAUt in your wallet, the ounce unit of XAUt is foreign to the Koreans perspective.
This contract wraps XAUt to kdXAUt in `Don` units to help Koreans intuitively see 'how much I have'.
